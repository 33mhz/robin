# Robin - Android Client

This is an Android client (Robin) for the pnut.io service. It was originally created for App.net by [Callum Taylor](http://callumtaylor.net) and [Romain Piel](http://romainpiel.com/), with [Damian Gribben](https://twitter.com/simpleline) as designer. Romain left development in the end of 2012 and Callum and Damian continued development until its shutdown in mid 2014. Since then it has been adapted for pnut.io by @33MHz.

Version 2 of the app began late 2013 and continued until the shutdown.

There should be no sensitive data in the source code, but if there is, please let me know!

The code is provided as-is and has not been maintained. It needs many updates from deprecated libraries and practices.

Version 2 was originally built using Android Studio version 0.4 and Gradle 0.9.

You **may not** fork the project, rename and sell it as-is.

As with the GPL, you may use the code for commercial use, but dont just fork the entire project and re-release it under a different name, that would make you a dick.

If we meet some day, and you find this stuff is worth it, you can buy me a beer in return.

The code is provided as-is without warrenty. Use and execute at your own risk, send a post or PM to @33MHz on pnut.io with bugs.
